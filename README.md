# Check Point MCP Servers

This repository contains a collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for Check Point security platforms, implemented in TypeScript. Each MCP server is organized as a separate package within this monorepo structure.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers expose a structured, machine-readable API for your enterprise data—designed for AI-powered automation, copilots, and decision engines. By delivering a clear, contextual slice of your security environment, MCP lets you query, analyze, and optimize complex systems without building custom SDKs or parsing raw exports.

## Why MCP for Check Point Security?
 
Security policies often span hundreds of rules and thousands of objects across diverse enforcement points. Understanding, auditing, or optimizing these environments is slow and error-prone. 

MCP changes this: exposing security management data in a modular, context-rich format, ready for AI systems to consume. Enabling the AI to use your data with precision. Ask real-world questions, and get structured, actionable answers—instantly.

## Repository Structure

## Example: Setting Up an MCP Server

Here's an example of how to configure the Management MCP server in your MCP client:

```json
{
  "MCP-NAME": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "@chkp/MCP_NPM_PACKAGE"
    ],
    "env": {
        // Specific server configuration 
    }
  }
}
```

__Each MCP server has its own specific configuration requirements. Please refer to the individual package README files for detailed setup instructions.__

## ⚠️ Security Notice

1. **Authentication keys and credentials are never shared with the model.** They are used only by the MCP server to authenticate with your Check Point management system.  
2. **Only use client implementations you trust.** Malicious or untrusted clients could misuse your credentials or access data improperly.  
3. **Queried Data will be exposed to the model.** Ensure that you only use models and providers that comply with your organization's policies for handling sensitive data and PII.

## 📊 Telemetry and Privacy

Check Point collects anonymous usage statistics to improve MCP servers. Only tool usage patterns and anonymous identifiers are collected—no credentials, policies, or sensitive data.

**Opt-Out:** Set `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` environment variable or use the `--no-telemetry` flag to disable telemetry collection.
