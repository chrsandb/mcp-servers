# Check Point Quantum Gateway MCP Server

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers expose a structured, machine-readable API for your enterprise data—designed for AI-powered automation, copilots, and decision engines. By delivering a clear, contextual slice of your security environment, MCP lets you query, analyze, and optimize complex systems without building custom SDKs or parsing raw exports.

## Why MCP for Gateway CLI?
 
Gateway configurations often span hundreds of routes, middleware chains, and policy rules across diverse API endpoints. Traditional CLI tools are cryptic, verbose, and hard to interpret—making understanding, monitoring, or optimizing these environments slow and error-prone.
MCP changes this: exposing gateway management data in a modular, context-rich format, ready for AI systems to consume. No more deciphering complex command outputs or wrestling with arcane syntax. Enabling the AI to use your gateway data with precision. Ask real-world questions about traffic patterns, route configurations, and performance metrics—and get structured, actionable answers—instantly.

## Features

- Hardware & System Diagnostics: Query DMI decode information, asset details, and comprehensive system information
- Network Configuration Analysis: Retrieve and analyze interface configurations, VLAN setups, and routing tables
- High Availability Monitoring: Inspect cluster status, interface synchronization, and HA failover states
- Performance & Security Analytics: Analyze SecureXL statistics, firewall modules, and connection acceleration metrics
- Real-time Connection Debugging: Start and stop live connection analysis for traffic troubleshooting and diagnostics

## Management API Version

This server supports **Management API v2.1 (R82.10+)**. It is generally compatible with earlier versions; some parameters may not be available on older management servers.

## Configuration Options

> **📊 Anonymous Usage Statistics:** Check Point collects anonymous usage statistics to help improve this MCP server.  To opt out, set `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` or use `--no-telemetry` flag.

This server supports two main modes of authentication:

### 1. Smart-1 Cloud (API Key)

Authenticate to Check Point Smart-1 Cloud using an API key.

- **How to generate an API key:**  
  In your Smart-1 Cloud dashboard, go to **Settings → API & SmartConsole** and generate an API key.  
  Copy the key and the server login URL (excluding the `/login` suffix) to your client settings.  
  ![alt text](./../../resources/s1c_api_key.png)

Set the following environment variables:

- `API_KEY`: Your Smart-1 Cloud API key  
- `S1C_URL`: Your Smart-1 Cloud tenant "Web-API" URL  
  
---

### 2. On-Prem Management (API Key or Username/Password)

- **Configure your management server to allow API access:**  
  To use this server with an on-premises Check Point management server, you must first enable API access.  
  Follow the official instructions for [Managing Security through API](https://sc1.checkpoint.com/documents/R82/WebAdminGuides/EN/CP_R82_SmartProvisioning_AdminGuide/Content/Topics-SPROVG/Managing-Security-through-API.htm).

- **Authenticate to the Security Management Server** using either an API key or username/password:  
  - Follow the official instructions: [Managing Administrator Accounts (Check Point R81+)](https://sc1.checkpoint.com/documents/R81/WebAdminGuides/EN/CP_R81_SecurityManagement_AdminGuide/Topics-SECMG/Managing_Administrator_Accounts.htm)  
  - When creating the administrator, assign appropriate permissions for API access and management operations.  
  - You can authenticate using an API key (recommended for automation) or username/password credentials.

Set the following environment variables:

- `MANAGEMENT_HOST`: IP address or hostname of your management server  
- `PORT`: (Optional) Management server port (default: 443)  
- `API_KEY`: Your management API key (if using API key authentication)  
- `USERNAME`: Username for authentication (if using username/password authentication)  
- `PASSWORD`: Password for authentication (if using username/password authentication)

## Client Configuration

### Prerequisites

Download and install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it installed.  
You can check your installed version by running:

```bash
node -v      # Should print "v20" or higher
nvm current  # Should print "v20" or higher
```

### Supported Clients

This server has been tested with Claude Desktop, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf clients.  
It is expected to work with any MCP client that supports the Model Context Protocol.

> **Note:** Due to the nature of management API calls and the variety of server tools, using this server may require a paid subscription to the model provider to support token limits and context window sizes.  
> For smaller models, you can reduce token usage by limiting the number of enabled tools in the client.

### Smart-1 Cloud Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quantum-gw-cli": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@chkp/quantum-gw-cli-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "S1C_URL": "YOUR_S1C_URL" // e.g., https://xxxxxxxx.maas.checkpoint.com/yyyyyyy/web_api
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### On-Prem Management Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quantum-gw-cli": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@chkp/quantum-gw-cli-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MANAGEMENT_HOST": "YOUR_MANAGEMENT_IP_OR_HOST_NAME",
        "MANAGEMENT_PORT": "443", // optional, default is 443
        "API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY", // or use USERNAME and PASSWORD
        "USERNAME": "YOUR_USERNAME", // optional
        "PASSWORD": "YOUR_PASSWORD"  // optional
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Set only the environment variables required for your authentication method.

### Configuring the Claude Desktop App

## HTTP Transport

By default, this server uses **stdio** transport, which is the standard mode for MCP clients like Claude Desktop and Cursor. For hosted or multi-user deployments, an **HTTP transport** (MCP Streamable HTTP) is also available.

> **Security notice before you continue:** The HTTP server has no built-in authentication and no TLS. Any client that can reach the port can establish a session, and credentials travel in cleartext. Only use HTTP transport behind an authenticated reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, a cloud load balancer) that terminates TLS and enforces authentication. If you are running the server on the same machine as your MCP client, use the default stdio transport — it has none of these concerns.

### Starting the server in HTTP mode

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http MCP_TRANSPORT_PORT=3000 npx @chkp/quantum-gw-cli-mcp
# or
npx @chkp/quantum-gw-cli-mcp --transport http --transport-port 3000
```

The server exposes:
- `POST/GET/DELETE /mcp` — MCP protocol endpoint
- `GET /health` — server status (active session count, version)

### Connecting an MCP client

Point your MCP client at `http://<host>:3000/mcp`. Example for Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quantum-gw-cli": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+  
- npm 10+  

### Setup

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install
```

### Build

```bash
# Build all packages
npm run build
```

### Running Locally

You can run the server locally for development using [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) or any compatible MCP client.

## ⚠️ Security Notice

1. **Authentication keys and credentials are never shared with the model.** They are used only by the MCP server to authenticate with your Check Point management system.  
2. **Only use client implementations you trust.** Malicious or untrusted clients could misuse your credentials or access data improperly.  
3. **Management data is exposed to the model.** Ensure that you only use models and providers that comply with your organization's policies for handling sensitive data and PII.

## 📊 Telemetry and Privacy

**Anonymous Usage Statistics:** Check Point collects anonymous usage statistics to improve this MCP server. Only tool usage patterns and anonymous identifiers are collected—no credentials, policies, or sensitive data.

**Opt-Out:** Set `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` environment variable or use the `--no-telemetry` flag to disable telemetry collection.
