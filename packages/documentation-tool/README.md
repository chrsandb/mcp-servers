# Check Point Documentation Tool MCP

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers expose a structured, machine-readable API for your enterprise data—designed for AI-powered automation, copilots, and decision engines. By delivering a clear, contextual slice of your security environment, MCP lets you query, analyze, and optimize complex systems without building custom SDKs or parsing raw exports.

## Why MCP for Check Point Documentation Tool?
 
The Check Point Documentation Tool provides seamless access to Check Point Documentation Tool services through the Model Context Protocol. It enables AI assistants to interact with Check Point Documentation Tool, making it easier to get accurate answers about Check Point products, configurations, and best practices.

## Use with other MCPs for Best Results
While the Documentation Tool works well on its own for documentation queries, it is designed to be used alongside other Check Point MCP servers (found in this repo) to provide comprehensive context about your security environment and correlate documentation with live system data.

## Features

- Access to Check Point Documentation Tool services and knowledge base
- Search functionality for finding relevant documentation through Documentation Tool
- Real-time retrieval of Check Point product information via Documentation Tool
- Integration with AI assistants for contextual help and guidance

## Example Use Cases

### Documentation Lookup
"Find documentation about Check Point firewall rule configuration."  
*→ Searches and returns relevant Check Point documentation about firewall rule setup and configuration best practices through Documentation Tool.*

### Product Information
"What are the system requirements for Check Point R81.20?"  
*→ Retrieves specific product documentation with system requirements and compatibility information.*

### Troubleshooting Guidance
"How do I troubleshoot VPN connectivity issues in Check Point?"  
*→ Returns step-by-step troubleshooting guides and diagnostic procedures from Check Point documentation.*

## Configuration Options

> **📊 Anonymous Usage Statistics:** Check Point collects anonymous usage statistics to help improve this MCP server.  To opt out, set `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` or use `--no-telemetry` flag.

This server supports configuration via command-line arguments or environment variables:

### API Configuration

The Check Point Documentation Tool MCP server requires authentication credentials for accessing Check Point Documentation Tool services.

#### Acquiring Credentials

To obtain the required API credentials:

1. **Login to Infinity Portal**: Navigate to your Check Point Infinity Portal
2. **Access API Keys**: Go to the "API Keys" menu
3. **Create New Key**: Click "New" → "New User API Key"
4. **Save Credentials**: Copy the generated `CLIENT_ID` and `SECRET_KEY`

#### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

- `CLIENT_ID`: Client ID for authentication with Check Point Documentation Tool (required)
- `SECRET_KEY`: Secret Key for authentication with Check Point Documentation Tool (required)
- `AUTH_URL`: Authentication URL copied from the API key creation dialog (e.g. `https://cloudinfra-gw.portal.checkpoint.com/auth/external`). Recommended — the path suffix is stripped automatically so you can paste it directly. When set, `REGION` is inferred and does not need to be set separately.
- `REGION`: Short region code — `EU`, `US`, `STG`, or `LOCAL` (default: `EU`). Use this instead of `AUTH_URL` for backwards-compatible configurations.
  
---

### On-Prem Example Configuration

For on-premises Check Point Documentation Tool deployment:

Set the following environment variables:

- `CLIENT_ID`: Your client ID for Documentation Tool authentication
- `SECRET_KEY`: Your secret key for Documentation Tool authentication
- `REGION`: Set to `LOCAL` for on-premises deployment

## Client Configuration

### Prerequisites

Download and install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it installed.  
You can check your installed version by running:

```bash
node -v      # Should print "v20" or higher
nvm current  # Should print "v20" or higher
```

### Supported Clients

This server has been tested with Claude Desktop, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf clients.  
It is expected to work with any MCP client that supports the Model Context Protocol.

### Basic Configuration Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "checkpoint-documentation-tool": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@chkp/documentation-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CLIENT_ID": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        "SECRET_KEY": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
        "AUTH_URL": "YOUR_AUTH_URL"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Tip:** Copy `AUTH_URL` directly from the Authentication URL shown in the API key creation dialog. The path suffix is stripped automatically — no manual editing needed.

### Configuring the Claude Desktop App

#### For macOS:

```bash
# Create the config file if it doesn't exist
touch "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"

# Open the config file in TextEdit
open -e "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"
```

#### For Windows:

```cmd
code %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

Add the server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "checkpoint-documentation-tool": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@chkp/documentation-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CLIENT_ID": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        "SECRET_KEY": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
        "AUTH_URL": "YOUR_AUTH_URL"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## HTTP Transport

By default, this server uses **stdio** transport, which is the standard mode for MCP clients like Claude Desktop and Cursor. For hosted or multi-user deployments, an **HTTP transport** (MCP Streamable HTTP) is also available.

> **Security notice before you continue:** The HTTP server has no built-in authentication and no TLS. Any client that can reach the port can establish a session, and credentials travel in cleartext. Only use HTTP transport behind an authenticated reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, a cloud load balancer) that terminates TLS and enforces authentication. If you are running the server on the same machine as your MCP client, use the default stdio transport — it has none of these concerns.

### Starting the server in HTTP mode

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http MCP_TRANSPORT_PORT=3000 npx @chkp/documentation-mcp
# or
npx @chkp/documentation-mcp --transport http --transport-port 3000
```

The server exposes:
- `POST/GET/DELETE /mcp` — MCP protocol endpoint
- `GET /health` — server status (active session count, version)

### Connecting an MCP client

Point your MCP client at `http://<host>:3000/mcp`. Example for Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "checkpoint-documentation-tool": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Security Notice

1. **Authentication keys and credentials are never shared with the model.** They are used only by the MCP server to authenticate with your Check Point management system.  
2. **Only use client implementations you trust.** Malicious or untrusted clients could misuse your credentials or access data improperly.  
3. **Management data is exposed to the model.** Ensure that you only use models and providers that comply with your organization's policies for handling sensitive data and PII.

## 📊 Telemetry and Privacy

**Anonymous Usage Statistics:** Check Point collects anonymous usage statistics to improve this MCP server. Only tool usage patterns and anonymous identifiers are collected—no credentials, policies, or sensitive data.

**Opt-Out:** Set `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` environment variable or use the `--no-telemetry` flag to disable telemetry collection.
