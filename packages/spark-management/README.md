# Check Point Spark Management MCP Server

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that enables AI agents to interact with external tools, services, and data sources in a secure and structured way. It defines a consistent interface for AI systems to discover and use capabilities such as reading files, querying databases, or sending messages through APIs.

## Why MCP for Spark Management?

The Spark Management provides centralized management and visibility for Check Point's Quantum Spark appliances, designed for MSPs managing small offices, branch offices, and distributed networks. It simplifies deployment, configuration.
 
MCP simplifies interactions with Spark Management data in a structured, modular, and context-rich format that AI systems can understand and utilize. This enables AI to interact intelligently with your Quantum Spark security environment, delivering precise, real-time, and actionable insights based on your queries and interests.

## Features

- Query and analyze gateway configurations and status
- Retrieve device information including software versions, connectivity status, and hardware details
- Manage and inspect gateway and plan administrators
- Access user configurations and permissions
- Get gateway geolocation and deployment information
- Analyze security plans and their applied configurations
- Monitor gateway health and licensing status


## Example Use Cases

### Gateway Status Monitoring

## Configuration Options

> **📊 Anonymous Usage Statistics:** Check Point collects anonymous usage statistics to help improve this MCP server.  To opt out, set `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` or use `--no-telemetry` flag.

This server supports configuration via command-line arguments for connecting to Check Point's Spark Management Platform:

### Required Parameters

- `--client-id`: Your API client ID for authentication
- `--secret-key`: Your API secret key for authentication

### Specifying Your Region / Portal URL

You need to tell the server which Check Point cloud region your account is on. Use **one** of these options:

- `--infinity-portal-url <url>` — Paste the **Authentication URL** shown in Step 4 of the API key creation dialog (e.g. `https://cloudinfra-gw.portal.checkpoint.com/auth/external`). The `/auth/external` path suffix is stripped automatically so the URL can be copied directly from the portal. This is the recommended approach because it removes any ambiguity about which region to use.
- `--region <code>` — Short region code: `EU`, `US`, `STG`, or `LOCAL`. Defaults to `EU`. Use this for backwards-compatible configurations that already have `REGION` set.

> **Note:** When `--infinity-portal-url` is provided, the region is inferred automatically from the URL. You do not need to set both.

## Client Configuration

### Prerequisites

Download and install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it installed.  
You can check your installed version by running:

```bash
node -v      # Should print "v20" or higher
nvm current  # Should print "v20" or higher
```
Receiving Credentials:

Step 1: Open API Keys<br>
Navigate to Quantum Spark Management portal and click on API Keys.
![API Keys Portal](../../resources/spark-management/api-keys-portal.png)<br>

Step 2: Create New Account API Key<br>
Click New and select New account API key or New user API key.
![Create API Key](../../resources/spark-management/create-api-key.png)<br>

Step 3: Fill in API Key Details<br>
Provide the required details such as Service(Quantum Spark Management), Expiration, Description, and Role, then click Create.
![API Key Details](../../resources/spark-management/api-key-details.png)<br>

Step 4: Save Your Credentials<br>
Copy and securely store the Client ID, Secret Key, and Authentication URL shown after creation.

### Supported Clients

This server has been tested with Claude Desktop, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf clients.  
It is expected to work with any MCP client that supports the Model Context Protocol.

### Basic Configuration Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "checkpoint-spark-management": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@chkp/spark-management-mcp"],
      "env": {
          "CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id",
          "SECRET_KEY": "your-secret-key",
          "INFINITY_PORTAL_URL": "YOUR_AUTH_URL"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Tip:** Copy the Authentication URL directly from the API key creation dialog (Step 4 above). The `/auth/external` path is stripped automatically — no need to edit the URL.

### Configuring the Claude Desktop App

#### Using a Bundled MCPB (formerly DXT)
1. Download the MCPB file: **[📥 spark-management.mcpb](https://github.com/CheckPointSW/mcp-servers/releases/latest/download/spark-management.mcpb)**
2. Open Claude Desktop App → Settings → Extensions
3. Drag the MCPB file and configure per the instructions.

#### Or Configure Manually

#### For macOS:

```bash
# Create the config file if it doesn't exist
touch "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"

# Open the config file in TextEdit
open -e "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"
```

#### For Windows:

```cmd
code %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

Add the server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "checkpoint-spark-management": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@chkp/spark-management-mcp"],
      "env": {
          "CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id",
          "SECRET_KEY": "your-secret-key",
          "INFINITY_PORTAL_URL": "YOUR_AUTH_URL"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## HTTP Transport

By default, this server uses **stdio** transport, which is the standard mode for MCP clients like Claude Desktop and Cursor. For hosted or multi-user deployments, an **HTTP transport** (MCP Streamable HTTP) is also available.

> **Security notice before you continue:** The HTTP server has no built-in authentication and no TLS. Any client that can reach the port can establish a session, and credentials travel in cleartext. Only use HTTP transport behind an authenticated reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, a cloud load balancer) that terminates TLS and enforces authentication. If you are running the server on the same machine as your MCP client, use the default stdio transport — it has none of these concerns.

### Starting the server in HTTP mode

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http MCP_TRANSPORT_PORT=3000 npx @chkp/spark-management-mcp
# or
npx @chkp/spark-management-mcp --transport http --transport-port 3000
```

The server exposes:
- `POST/GET/DELETE /mcp` — MCP protocol endpoint
- `GET /health` — server status (active session count, version)

### Connecting an MCP client

Point your MCP client at `http://<host>:3000/mcp`. Example for Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "checkpoint-spark-management": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Security Notice

1. **Authentication keys and credentials are never shared with the model.** They are used only by the MCP server to authenticate with your Check Point management system.  
2. **Only use client implementations you trust.** Malicious or untrusted clients could misuse your credentials or access data improperly.  
3. **Management data is exposed to the model.** Ensure that you only use models and providers that comply with your organization's policies for handling sensitive data and PII.

## 📊 Telemetry and Privacy

**Anonymous Usage Statistics:** Check Point collects anonymous usage statistics to improve this MCP server. Only tool usage patterns and anonymous identifiers are collected—no credentials, policies, or sensitive data.

**Opt-Out:** Set `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` environment variable or use the `--no-telemetry` flag to disable telemetry collection.
