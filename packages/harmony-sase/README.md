# Check Point Harmony SASE MCP Server

## What is MCP standard?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that enables AI agents to interact with external tools, services, and data sources in a secure and structured way. It defines a consistent interface for AI systems to discover and use capabilities such as reading files, querying databases, or sending messages through APIs.

## Why MCP for Harmony SASE?

Harmony SASE provides a unified platform for building secure private networks and managing access to the internet, private applications, and cloud infrastructure by creating access policy rules, this data is stored in Harmony SASE storage.

Valuable information and insights are often locked within this data, insights that could drive smart decisions and fast actions if made accessible.

MCP simplifies this by exposing your Harmony SASE data in a structured, modular, and context-rich format that AI systems can understand and utilize. This enables AI to interact intelligently with your environment, delivering precise, real-time, and actionable insights based on your queries and interests.

## Features

- Query Harmony SASE networks and their configurations

- Retrieve and analyze gateway deployments across regions

- List and inspect ZTA applications

- Get all available Network regions

- Get all the deployed GWs, regions and tunnels in the Network

## Configuration

> **📊 Anonymous Usage Statistics:** Check Point collects anonymous usage statistics to help improve this MCP server.  To opt out, set `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` or use `--no-telemetry` flag.

### Prerequisites

You need access to a Check Point Harmony SASE environment with API credentials.

**Configure a Bypass Rule for Selected AI Tools**

1. Navigate to Internet Access → Bypass Rules.
2. Click Add New Rule.
3. Enter a Name for the rule.
4. Under Applied On, if available, select Agent.
5. Set the Source (based on your policy requirements).
6. Set the Destination to the relevant application domains, for example:
    *.claude.ai
    *.anthropic.com
    *.api.anthropic.com

**How to get API credentials:**
In your Harmony SASE portal, navigate to **Settings → API support** and generate an API key.

Note your management host URL and origin domain for your tenant.

Set the following environment variables:

`API_KEY`: Your Harmony SASE API key

`MANAGEMENT_HOST`: Your Harmony SASE management API URL (e.g., `https://api.your-management-host.com/api`)

`ORIGIN`: Your tenant origin domain (e.g., `https://your.origin-domain.com`)

## Client Configuration

### Prerequisites

Download and install the latest version of [Node.js](Node.js — Download Node.js® ) if you don't already have it installed.

You can check your installed version by running:

```bash

node -v      # Should print "v20" or higher

nvm current  # Should print "v20" or higher

```

### Supported Clients

This server has been tested with Claude Desktop, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf clients.

It is expected to work with any MCP client that supports the Model Context Protocol.

> **Note:** Due to the nature of SASE API calls and the variety of server tools, using this server may require a paid subscription to the model provider to support token limits and context window sizes.

> For smaller models, you can reduce token usage by limiting the number of enabled tools in the client.

### Configuration Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "harmony-sase": {
      "command": "npx",

      "args": ["@chkp/harmony-sase-mcp"],

      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your-harmony-sase-api-key",

        "MANAGEMENT_HOST": "https://api.your-management-host.com/api",

        "ORIGIN": "https://your.origin-domain.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuring the Claude Desktop App

#### Using a Bundled MCPB (formerly DXT)
1. Download the MCPB file: **[📥 harmony-sase.mcpb](https://github.com/CheckPointSW/mcp-servers/releases/latest/download/harmony-sase.mcpb)**
2. Open Claude Desktop App → Settings → Extensions
3. Drag the MCPB file and configure per the instructions.

#### Or Configure Manually

#### For macOS:

```bash

# Create the config file if it doesn't exist

touch "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"



# Open the config file in TextEdit

open -e "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"

## HTTP Transport

By default, this server uses **stdio** transport, which is the standard mode for MCP clients like Claude Desktop and Cursor. For hosted or multi-user deployments, an **HTTP transport** (MCP Streamable HTTP) is also available.

> **Security notice before you continue:** The HTTP server has no built-in authentication and no TLS. Any client that can reach the port can establish a session, and credentials travel in cleartext. Only use HTTP transport behind an authenticated reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, a cloud load balancer) that terminates TLS and enforces authentication. If you are running the server on the same machine as your MCP client, use the default stdio transport — it has none of these concerns.

### Starting the server in HTTP mode

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http MCP_TRANSPORT_PORT=3000 npx @chkp/harmony-sase-mcp
# or
npx @chkp/harmony-sase-mcp --transport http --transport-port 3000
```

The server exposes:
- `POST/GET/DELETE /mcp` — MCP protocol endpoint
- `GET /health` — server status (active session count, version)

### Connecting an MCP client

Point your MCP client at `http://<host>:3000/mcp`. Example for Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "harmony-sase": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Security Requirements

API keys and credentials are never shared with the model

Only use client implementations you trust

Ensure that you only use models and providers that comply with your organization's policies for handling sensitive infrastructure data and PII.

## 📊 Telemetry and Privacy

**Anonymous Usage Statistics:** Check Point collects anonymous usage statistics to improve this MCP server. Only tool usage patterns and anonymous identifiers are collected—no credentials, policies, or sensitive data.

**Opt-Out:** Set `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` environment variable or use the `--no-telemetry` flag to disable telemetry collection.
