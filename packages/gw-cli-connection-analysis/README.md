# Check Point Quantum Gateway Connection Analysis MCP Server

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers expose a structured, machine-readable API for your enterprise data—designed for AI-powered automation, copilots, and decision engines. By delivering a clear, contextual slice of your security environment, MCP lets you query, analyze, and optimize complex systems without building custom SDKs or parsing raw exports.

## Why MCP for Gateway Connection Analysis?
 
Troubleshooting connection issues on Check Point gateways can be challenging and time-consuming. Traditional debugging methods require extensive CLI knowledge, manual log analysis, and complex packet captures.

This MCP server simplifies connection debugging by providing structured, context-rich data about connections flowing through your gateway. It enables AI systems to help you troubleshoot connectivity issues by starting a connection analysis session, analyzing the results, and providing actionable insights about what's happening with your traffic.

## Features

- Real-time Connection Analysis: Start and stop live connection debugging sessions
- Source and Destination Tracking: Track connections between specific IP addresses
- Comprehensive Connection Data: View packet path, security policy decisions, NAT rules applied, and more
- Interactive Troubleshooting: Start a session, reproduce an issue, then analyze the results

## How Connection Analysis Works

1. **Start the analysis**: Specify the source and destination IP addresses to monitor
2. **Reproduce the issue**: Generate the traffic that's experiencing problems
3. **Stop the analysis**: Capture the results and get a detailed report on what happened

## Management API Version

This server supports **Management API v2.1 (R82.10+)**. It is generally compatible with earlier versions; some parameters may not be available on older management servers.

## Example Use Cases

### Basic Connection Troubleshooting
"Why can't my client at 10.0.1.5 reach the server at 192.168.1.10? Let's debug the connection."
*→ Starts a connection analysis session, guides you through reproducing the issue, then explains where the traffic is being blocked or dropped.*

### NAT Verification
"Check if traffic from 10.1.1.100 to external server 203.0.113.50 is being properly NAT'ed."
*→ Analyzes the connection to show which NAT rules are applied and how the addresses are translated.*


### Connection Path Analysis
"Trace the exact path of packets from 10.0.2.15 to database server 10.0.3.25."
*→ Details each step of the packet journey through interfaces, security policies, and network functions.*

## ⚠️ Performance Notice
The Connection Analysis tool starts a debug session on your gateway for specific connections. It may have performance repercussions. Make sure to stop the session when you no longer need it.

## Configuration Options

> **📊 Anonymous Usage Statistics:** Check Point collects anonymous usage statistics to help improve this MCP server.  To opt out, set `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` or use `--no-telemetry` flag.

This server supports two main modes of authentication:

### 1. Smart-1 Cloud (API Key)

Authenticate to Check Point Smart-1 Cloud using an API key.

- **How to generate an API key:**  
  In your Smart-1 Cloud dashboard, go to **Settings → API & SmartConsole** and generate an API key.  
  Copy the key and the server login URL (excluding the `/login` suffix) to your client settings.  
  ![alt text](./../../resources/s1c_api_key.png)

Set the following environment variables:

- `API_KEY`: Your Smart-1 Cloud API key  
- `S1C_URL`: Your Smart-1 Cloud tenant "Web-API" URL  
  
---

### 2. On-Prem Management (API Key or Username/Password)

- **Configure your management server to allow API access:**  
  To use this server with an on-premises Check Point management server, you must first enable API access.  
  Follow the official instructions for [Managing Security through API](https://sc1.checkpoint.com/documents/R82/WebAdminGuides/EN/CP_R82_SmartProvisioning_AdminGuide/Content/Topics-SPROVG/Managing-Security-through-API.htm).

- **Authenticate to the Security Management Server** using either an API key or username/password:  
  - Follow the official instructions: [Managing Administrator Accounts (Check Point R81+)](https://sc1.checkpoint.com/documents/R81/WebAdminGuides/EN/CP_R81_SecurityManagement_AdminGuide/Topics-SECMG/Managing_Administrator_Accounts.htm)  
  - When creating the administrator, assign appropriate permissions for API access and management operations.  
  - You can authenticate using an API key (recommended for automation) or username/password credentials.

Set the following environment variables:

- `MANAGEMENT_HOST`: IP address or hostname of your management server  
- `PORT`: (Optional) Management server port (default: 443)  
- `API_KEY`: Your management API key (if using API key authentication)  
- `USERNAME`: Username for authentication (if using username/password authentication)  
- `PASSWORD`: Password for authentication (if using username/password authentication)

## Client Configuration

### Prerequisites

Download and install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it installed.  
You can check your installed version by running:

```bash
node -v      # Should print "v20" or higher
nvm current  # Should print "v20" or higher
```

### Supported Clients

This server has been tested with Claude Desktop, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf clients.  
It is expected to work with any MCP client that supports the Model Context Protocol.

> **Note:** Due to the nature of management API calls and the variety of server tools, using this server may require a paid subscription to the model provider to support token limits and context window sizes.  
> For smaller models, you can reduce token usage by limiting the number of enabled tools in the client.

### Smart-1 Cloud Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quantum-gw-connection-analysis": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@chkp/quantum-gw-connection-analysis-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "S1C_URL": "YOUR_S1C_URL" // e.g., https://xxxxxxxx.maas.checkpoint.com/yyyyyyy/web_api
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### On-Prem Management Example

## HTTP Transport

By default, this server uses **stdio** transport, which is the standard mode for MCP clients like Claude Desktop and Cursor. For hosted or multi-user deployments, an **HTTP transport** (MCP Streamable HTTP) is also available.

> **Security notice before you continue:** The HTTP server has no built-in authentication and no TLS. Any client that can reach the port can establish a session, and credentials travel in cleartext. Only use HTTP transport behind an authenticated reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, a cloud load balancer) that terminates TLS and enforces authentication. If you are running the server on the same machine as your MCP client, use the default stdio transport — it has none of these concerns.

### Starting the server in HTTP mode

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http MCP_TRANSPORT_PORT=3000 npx @chkp/quantum-gw-connection-analysis-mcp
# or
npx @chkp/quantum-gw-connection-analysis-mcp --transport http --transport-port 3000
```

The server exposes:
- `POST/GET/DELETE /mcp` — MCP protocol endpoint
- `GET /health` — server status (active session count, version)

### Connecting an MCP client

Point your MCP client at `http://<host>:3000/mcp`. Example for Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quantum-gw-connection-analysis": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Security Notice

1. **Authentication keys and credentials are never shared with the model.** They are used only by the MCP server to authenticate with your Check Point management system.  
2. **Only use client implementations you trust.** Malicious or untrusted clients could misuse your credentials or access data improperly.  
3. **Management data is exposed to the model.** Ensure that you only use models and providers that comply with your organization's policies for handling sensitive data and PII.

## 📊 Telemetry and Privacy

**Anonymous Usage Statistics:** Check Point collects anonymous usage statistics to improve this MCP server. Only tool usage patterns and anonymous identifiers are collected—no credentials, policies, or sensitive data.

**Opt-Out:** Set `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` environment variable or use the `--no-telemetry` flag to disable telemetry collection.
