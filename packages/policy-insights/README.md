# Check Point Policy Insights MCP Server

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers expose a structured, machine-readable API for your enterprise data—designed for AI-powered automation, copilots, and decision engines. By delivering a clear, contextual slice of your security environment, MCP lets you query, analyze, and optimize complex systems without building custom SDKs or parsing raw exports.

## Why MCP for Security?

Security Policies often span hundreds of rules and thousands of objects across diverse enforcement points. Understanding, auditing, or optimizing these environments is slow and error-prone. 
MCP changes this: exposing security management data in a modular, context-rich format, ready for AI systems to consume. Enabling the AI to use your data with precision. Ask real-world questions, and get structured, actionable answers—instantly.

## Recommendation

For a better experience, we recommend using this MCP **along with** the [Quantum Management MCP](../management/README.md) (`@chkp/quantum-management-mcp`).

Together they give you the full picture: combine actual rule content with insights content in one place, search by layer/rule name (or other filters allowed by Quantum Management MCP) instead of IDs, view insights while seeing the object details instead of object IDs, and more.


## Features

- Provide information for the Policy Insights card in Infinity Cloud Services
- Check if Policy Insights is on and see product status and license info
- See how many insights you have per type on a layer, and when the last publish it was based on
- Find which rules have insights on a layer, including rules in inline layers
- Get insights content from specific layer / rule
- Filter insights with params like confidence, suggestion type, security impact
- Find insights you moved to decide later or declined in the past
- Get user configuration and settings for Policy Insights
- Get when new insights are planned to be generated
- Retrieve detailed information when you can't see insights

## Management API Version

This server supports **Management API v2.1 (R82.10+)**. It is generally compatible with earlier versions; some parameters may not be available on older management servers.

## Example Use Cases

### Finding Which Rules Have Insights
"Which rules have unused objects?" / "Which rules are too permissive and should be tightened?" / "Which disabled rules can be deleted?" / "Which rules have no hits and can be deleted?"
You can filter by specific security score, confidence

### Getting Insights Content for layer
"Show me the insights for layer ID a9182588-92dd-4e03-85b5-1dd360b63f69" / "Show me the insights for layer name (works only if you use @chkp/quantum-management-mcp)." 

### Getting Insights Content for rule
"Show me the insights for rule ID a9182588-92dd-4e03-85b5-1dd360b63f69" / "Show me the insights for rule [name/number], combine it with the actual rule content (works only if you use @chkp/quantum-management-mcp)."

### Summary
"How many insights do I have on layer id a9182588-92dd-4e03-85b5-1dd360b63f69?" / "How many insights do I have on layer [name] (works only if you use @chkp/quantum-management-mcp)?" / "Create a report of all the layers and the count of insights each in policy package [name] (works only if you use @chkp/quantum-management-mcp)"

### Getting insights with action made on them
"Show me how many (or which) insights are in decide later in layer ID a9182588-92dd-4e03-85b5-1dd360b63f69" / "Show me how many insights are in decide later for layer [name] (works only if you use @chkp/quantum-management-mcp)" / "Show many how many (or which) insights are declined in layer ID a9182588-92dd-4e03-85b5-1dd360b63f69"

### Scheduling
"When were the current insights created?" / "What publish timestamp are the current insights based on?" / "When is the next run planned to generate new insights?"

### Onboarding and Troubleshooting
"Why do I see no insights?" / "Has a Policy Insights suggestion been generated yet?" / "What if I only have low-confidence insights?"

### Licensing
"When does my Policy Insights license expire?" / "What's my policy insights status?"

## HTTP Transport

By default, this server uses **stdio** transport, which is the standard mode for MCP clients like Claude Desktop and Cursor. For hosted or multi-user deployments, an **HTTP transport** (MCP Streamable HTTP) is also available.

> **Security notice before you continue:** The HTTP server has no built-in authentication and no TLS. Any client that can reach the port can establish a session, and credentials travel in cleartext. Only use HTTP transport behind an authenticated reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, a cloud load balancer) that terminates TLS and enforces authentication. If you are running the server on the same machine as your MCP client, use the default stdio transport — it has none of these concerns.

### Starting the server in HTTP mode

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http MCP_TRANSPORT_PORT=3000 npx @chkp/policy-insights-mcp
# or
npx @chkp/policy-insights-mcp --transport http --transport-port 3000
```

The server exposes:
- `POST/GET/DELETE /mcp` — MCP protocol endpoint
- `GET /health` — server status (active session count, version)

### Connecting an MCP client

Point your MCP client at `http://<host>:3000/mcp`. Example for Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "policy-insights": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Security Notice

1. **Authentication keys and credentials are never shared with the model.** They are used only by the MCP server to authenticate with your Check Point management system.  
2. **Only use client implementations you trust.** Malicious or untrusted clients could misuse your credentials or access data improperly.  
3. **Management data is exposed to the model.** Ensure that you only use models and providers that comply with your organization's policies for handling sensitive data and PII.

## 📊 Telemetry and Privacy

**Anonymous Usage Statistics:** Check Point collects anonymous usage statistics to improve this MCP server. Only tool usage patterns and anonymous identifiers are collected—no credentials, policies, or sensitive data.

**Opt-Out:** Set `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` environment variable or use the `--no-telemetry` flag to disable telemetry collection.
