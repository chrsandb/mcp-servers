## Client Configuration

> **📊 Anonymous Usage Statistics:** Check Point collects anonymous usage statistics to help improve this MCP server.  To opt out, set `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` or use `--no-telemetry` flag.

### Prerequisites

Download and install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it installed.  
You can check your installed version by running:

```bash
node -v      # Should print "v22" or higher
nvm current  # Should print "v22" or higher
```

### Supported Clients

This server has been tested with Claude Desktop, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf clients.  
It is expected to work with any MCP client that supports the Model Context Protocol.

### Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "reputation-service": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@chkp/reputation-service-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Set only the environment variables required for your authentication method.

### Configuring the Claude Desktop App

#### Using a Bundled MCPB (formerly DXT)
1. Download the MCPB file: **[📥 reputation-service.mcpb](https://github.com/CheckPointSW/mcp-servers/releases/latest/download/reputation-service.mcpb)**
2. Open Claude Desktop App → Settings → Extensions
3. Drag the MCPB file and configure per the instructions.

#### Or Configure Manually

#### For macOS:

```bash
# Create the config file if it doesn't exist
touch "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"

# Open the config file in TextEdit
open -e "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"
```

#### For Windows:

```cmd
code %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

Add the server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "reputation-service": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@chkp/reputation-service-mcp"],
      "env": {
        // Add the configuration from the above instructions
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### VSCode 

Enter VSCode settings and type "mcp" in the search bar.
You should see the option to edit the configuration file.
Add this configuration:

```json
{
  ...
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [],
    "servers": {
      "reputation-service": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "@chkp/reputation-service-mcp"
        ],
        "env": {
          "API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

### Windsurf

Enter Windsurf settings and type "mcp" in the search bar.
You should see the option to edit the configuration file.
Add the configuration as Claude Desktop App.

### Cursor

Enter Cursor settings and click on "MCP Servers" in the left menu.
You should see the option to add a new MCP Server.
Add the configuration as Claude Desktop App.

## HTTP Transport

By default, this server uses **stdio** transport, which is the standard mode for MCP clients like Claude Desktop and Cursor. For hosted or multi-user deployments, an **HTTP transport** (MCP Streamable HTTP) is also available.

> **Security notice before you continue:** The HTTP server has no built-in authentication and no TLS. Any client that can reach the port can establish a session, and credentials travel in cleartext. Only use HTTP transport behind an authenticated reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, a cloud load balancer) that terminates TLS and enforces authentication. If you are running the server on the same machine as your MCP client, use the default stdio transport — it has none of these concerns.

### Starting the server in HTTP mode

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http MCP_TRANSPORT_PORT=3000 npx @chkp/reputation-service-mcp
# or
npx @chkp/reputation-service-mcp --transport http --transport-port 3000
```

The server exposes:
- `POST/GET/DELETE /mcp` — MCP protocol endpoint
- `GET /health` — server status (active session count, version)

### Connecting an MCP client

Point your MCP client at `http://<host>:3000/mcp`. Example for Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "reputation-service": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+  
- npm 10+  

### Setup

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install
```

### Build

```bash
# Build all packages
npm run build
```

### Running Locally

You can run the server locally for development using [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) or any compatible MCP client.

```bash
node FULL_PATH_TO_SERVER/packages/reputation-service/dist/index.js --api-key
```

## ⚠️ Security Notice

1. **Authentication keys and credentials are never shared with the model.** They are used only by the MCP server to authenticate with Check Point Reputation Service.  
2. **Only use client implementations you trust.** Malicious or untrusted clients could misuse your credentials or access data improperly.

## 📊 Telemetry and Privacy

**Anonymous Usage Statistics:** Check Point collects anonymous usage statistics to improve this MCP server. Only tool usage patterns and anonymous identifiers are collected—no credentials, policies, or sensitive data.

**Opt-Out:** Set `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` environment variable or use the `--no-telemetry` flag to disable telemetry collection.
