# Check Point Argos ERM MCP

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers expose a structured, machine-readable API for your enterprise data—designed for AI-powered automation, copilots, and decision engines. By delivering a clear, contextual slice of your security environment, MCP lets you query, analyze, and optimize complex systems without building custom SDKs or parsing raw exports.

## Why MCP for Argos ERM?
 
The Argos ERM MCP Server provides programmatic access to Check Point's Argos External Risk Management platform. It enables AI assistants and automation tools to query risk assessments, compliance data, and security posture information directly from your Argos deployment.

## Use with other MCPs for Best Results
While the Argos ERM MCP works well on its own, it is designed to integrate with other Check Point MCP servers for comprehensive security management workflows.

## Configuration Options

This server supports configuration via command-line arguments or environment variables:

### Argos ERM Configuration

The Argos ERM server requires connection details to your Argos instance.

Set the following environment variables:

- `ARGOS_HOST` (or `ARGOS_SERVER_URL`): Your Argos ERM server URL (e.g., `https://argos.example.com`)
- `ARGOS_API_KEY` (or `ARGOS_INTEGRATION_TOKEN`): Your Argos ERM API authentication token
- `ARGOS_CUSTOMER_ID`: Your Argos customer ID (required for all API calls)
  
---

## Client Configuration

### Prerequisites

Download and install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it installed.  
You can check your installed version by running:

```bash
node -v      # Should print "v18" or higher
nvm current  # Should print "v18" or higher
```

### Supported Clients

This server has been tested with Claude Desktop, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf clients.  
It is expected to work with any MCP client that supports the Model Context Protocol.

### Basic Configuration Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "argos-erm": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@chkp/argos-erm-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ARGOS_HOST": "https://your-argos-instance.com",
        "ARGOS_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "ARGOS_CUSTOMER_ID": "your-customer-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuring the Claude Desktop App

#### For macOS:

```bash
# Create the config file if it doesn't exist
touch "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"

# Open the config file in TextEdit
open -e "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"
```

#### For Windows:

## HTTP Transport

By default, this server uses **stdio** transport, which is the standard mode for MCP clients like Claude Desktop and Cursor. For hosted or multi-user deployments, an **HTTP transport** (MCP Streamable HTTP) is also available.

> **Security notice before you continue:** The HTTP server has no built-in authentication and no TLS. Any client that can reach the port can establish a session, and credentials travel in cleartext. Only use HTTP transport behind an authenticated reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, a cloud load balancer) that terminates TLS and enforces authentication. If you are running the server on the same machine as your MCP client, use the default stdio transport — it has none of these concerns.

### Starting the server in HTTP mode

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http MCP_TRANSPORT_PORT=3000 npx @chkp/argos-erm-mcp
# or
npx @chkp/argos-erm-mcp --transport http --transport-port 3000
```

The server exposes:
- `POST/GET/DELETE /mcp` — MCP protocol endpoint
- `GET /health` — server status (active session count, version)

### Connecting an MCP client

Point your MCP client at `http://<host>:3000/mcp`. Example for Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "argos-erm": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Security Notice

1. **Authentication keys and credentials are never shared with the model.** They are used only by the MCP server to authenticate with your Argos ERM system.  
2. **Only use client implementations you trust.** Malicious or untrusted clients could misuse your credentials or access data improperly.  
3. **Risk and compliance data is exposed to the model.** Ensure that you only use models and providers that comply with your organization's policies for handling sensitive data and PII.

## 📊 Telemetry and Privacy

**Anonymous Usage Statistics:** Check Point collects anonymous usage statistics to improve this MCP server. Only tool usage patterns and anonymous identifiers are collected—no credentials, policies, or sensitive data.

**Opt-Out:** Set `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` environment variable or use the `--no-telemetry` flag to disable telemetry collection.
